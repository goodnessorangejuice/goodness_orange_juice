               <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h4>Q: Why does my juice separate?</h4>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: When left standing for a while, fresh juice separates and most of the nutrients settle at the bottom. Fresh squeezed juice separates because of the interaction between enzymes in the fruit and the pectin in the juice. This is usually a good indication that your juice is fresh and you will observe this separation with your bottle of Goodness Orange Juice. </p>

        <h4>Q: Why does my juice NOT have consistent taste / flavour?</h4>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: Naturally, all fruits including oranges vary in taste depending on the variety, season and source, so there may be slight differences in the batches we produce. To keep the flavour/taste of orange juice consistent from batch to batch, manufacturers usually engineer the flavour and this is something we never do. Our orange juice is 100% natural with nothing extra added. We do not add sugar, water, chemical flavours or pasteurize.</p>
        <p>We get different varieties of oranges all the time and we ensure that we use only organic oranges that are in season for best quality yield. This means that our juice will keep having slightly different tastes according to the variety of the oranges used at each particular production time. Sometimes we use only one orange variety and other times we use a combination of 4 different orange varieties (Valencia, Ibadan sweet, Washington and Mandarin) in production. <strong>Some of these orange varieties are sweeter than the others BUT contain the same nutritional value including the same Vitamin C content</strong>. This again is usually a good indication that our juice is just as Mother Nature made it because we do not control the taste in anyway. If your juice tastes exactly the same all of the time, the reason is usually because it is not cold-pressed and has been processed.</p>

        <h4>Q: I am Diabetic. Can I have Goodness Orange Juice?</h4>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: While we hope that everyone will remain in good health, we think that it would be best to consult your doctor before taking Goodness orange juice or any other juice drink.</p>

        <h4>Q: Is Goodness Orange juice pasteurized?</h4>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: No. Goodness orange Juice is 100% cold-pressed. This means that we do not apply heat in our juice extraction and packaging processes. We simply squeeze and bottle. When juice is pasteurized or made from concentrate, the heat neutralizes enzymes which prevent separation. However, the fresh taste is lost and so does the nutritional value. By not applying heat, Goodness Orange Juice is not only superior in flavour (fresh taste) but also contains up to five times the amount of vitamins, trace minerals and enzymes. </p>

        <h4>Q: Is Goodness Orange Juice cholesterol free?</h4>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: Yes. Goodness Orange Juice is 100% cholesterol free</p>

        <h4>Q: What is the nutritional content of Goodness Orange Juice?</h4>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: Goodness Orange juice contains 100% vitamin C, calcium, potassium, magnesium, folate, thiamin,Iron, protein and vitamin A.</p>

        <h4>Q: Does Goodness Orange Juice contain added sugar?</h4>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: Absolutely Not.  Goodness Orange Juice does not contain added sugar,only naturally occurring sugars found in all fruits. Not even water, just oranges. The sweetness of the orange juice simply comes from natural sugars that develop in the oranges as they grow on the trees.</p>

        <h4>Q: Can I freeze Goodness Orange Juice?</h4>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, absolutely. In a situation where you would want to store some of your delicious bottles for later consumption, we recommend that you freeze the uncapped bottles immediately after purchase. Your juice should be fine for up to 2 weeks under constant freezing temperature. It is also important to check that the bottle is not filled to the brim to allow for expansion during freezing.</p>
