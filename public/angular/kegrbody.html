            The overall mission of KEGR is “adding value to everyday living”. We believe that if we can add value to the life of people by creating healthy quality products, selling at affordable prices, investing in sustainable business partnerships where our farmer-suppliers are fairly treated and taking care of our environment; then we would have done our corporate part.
        </p>
        <P> We create products that promote healthy eating habits in both adults and kids. Since taste preferences begin early in life, we believe that by providing affordable organic drinks for children, they will develop a life-long preference for healthier foods and drinks.</P>
