                        <h3>How Goodness Fresh Orange Juice is made</h3>
                        <p>Goodness Fresh Orange Juice is made from fresh organically grown oranges. All our oranges are sourced locally and handpicked to select oranges of the highest quality. The juice is extracted fresh from oranges every day and bottled in a hygienic environment. All our oranges have been organically grown by our farmer-partners and are unbelievably delicious.</p>
                        <h3>Our Juice Extraction Process</h3>
                        <p>Our process is simple; farm to bottle.  We gather fresh oranges of the finest quality straight from the farm, sort and wash beautifully well. The oranges are then moved to our extraction facility where we use COLD-PRESSED method to extract the juice from the oranges, one at a time. We never apply heat in our extraction process.  The juice extracted is then sprinkled with love and bottled beautifully in our PET bottle.</p>
                        <h3>What is inside Goodness Fresh Orange Juice (Nutritional Information)</h3>
                        <p>Each bottle of 500ml contains approximately 10 fresh oranges that have been organically grown. Nothing more is added. Our juice is never made from concentrate and does not contain preservatives. We do not add any additives or sugar to our juice, only the natural occurring sugars from the oranges. Each bottle of Goodness contains 100% pure fresh oranges, 100% of the time and makes up one of the recommended “5-a-day” fruits.</p>
                        <h3>Business Sustainability</h3>
                        <p>By sourcing our oranges locally, we ensure their quality and sustain their freshness until extraction. It also helps to support our local farmers and strengthen the economy of our local communities by providing jobs. We believe in fair trade and this means that we ensure our farmers get their entitled proceeds as we work to promote sustainable farming.</p>
